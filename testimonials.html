            <p>&ldquo;I’ve immensely enjoyed working with Mark over the past year to learn category theory and connect it with mental models of my own field. Mark does an excellent job of prioritizing learning: I chose a set of goal papers and topics to understand, and he helped determine and learn the necessary background. He was also able to dive into recent papers and break them down to help build my own understanding. Along the way, he was open to experimenting with different teaching styles to determine what worked best for me. Additionally, working with Mark logistically has been great, as he is flexible around scheduling conflicts with some warning.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Mark is one-of-a-kind. The multitudinous reasons why:</p>
            <p>Mark has expansive knowledge and skillsets in pure mathematics, physics, biology, cognitive science, philosophy, and a long array of other things.</p>
            <p>As a benefit of Mark’s wide-ranging interests and expertise, Mark is very good at at contextualizing the math you’re learning to pretty much any field you’re interested in.</p>
            <p>Mark’s penchant for autodidaction almost defies explanation. If you ever run up against something he doesn’t know, he’ll come back two days later with not only an answer, but an answer deeply contextualized to everything else you’ve been learning, and probably something else you haven’t. Mark has a frankly absurd ability to consume and integrate new information, which is a wonderful trait for a tutor who tutors quick and curious students.</p>
            <p>One thing I’ve deeply appreciated about Mark’s tutoring is his approach on fundamental mathematical skills: identifying and creating effective notation; selecting, synthesizing, and critiquing mathematical resources; keeping track of function type signatures; etc. This just isn’t something you’ll find elsewhere (probably not even in a mathematics degree). This derives from Mark’s long history as an autodidact who needs to filter incoming information, and furthermore from the fact that…</p>
            <p>Mark is a first-principles thinker.</p>
            <p>On flexibility: Mark will adapt his teaching style to you (he and I have probably tried 3-4 different styles), and his scheduling flexibility is terrific.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Just had Mark Moon teach me some basic category theory in preparation for learning Lawvere's theorem. It was absolutely awesome. Mark is a great teacher, and I have high standards. If you are interested in learning category theory or anything else Mark can teach, I strongly recommend booking him.&rdquo;</p>
